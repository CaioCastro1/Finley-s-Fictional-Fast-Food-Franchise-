# Finley-s-Fictional-Fast-Food-Franchise-
The challenge was to solve the following test: 

"Imagine you’re at Finley’s Fictional Fast Food Franchise ready to order. However, the machine that takes orders is acting up. Instead of taking orders as they are made, it randomly chooses to process either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd order that it receives, with equal probability. After it chooses an order, it forgets about orders earlier than the selected order and repeats this process for the next three orders.

For example, if Allie, Ben, Charlie, Dianne and Ellie’s are the first 5 orders, the machine will first randomly select between Allie, Ben and Charlie. If Ben's order is selected, Allie loses her order and the machine then again randomizes between Charlie, Dianne and Ellie.

You’re ready to place your order. There are more customers coming, and based on when they arrive, you can choose to be the very first in line to order (place the 1st order), or you could let some people go ahead of you so you’d be the fifth person (5th order), or you could even be eleventh in line (11th order). Your goal is to have the best shot at getting your meal from the fickle machine.

Which order position should you choose to increase your chances of actually getting your lunch (1st, 5th or 11th) and why?"

I was short on time so I did some brute force simulations for the first time.
